# Energy-Efficiency-
This repository contains the comparison between various machine learing algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree. Random Forest and Support Vector. I compared these regressor algorithms to check which one is best to be implemented.

## Overview
This comparison has been made on the Energy+Efficiency Dataset sourced from UCI Machine Learining Repository. This study looked into assessing the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings (that is, energy efficiency) as a function of building parameters.
